# 🔒 Deadlocks in Operating System

An **interactive learning project** that explains the concept of **Deadlocks** in Operating Systems through **animations, simulations, and visual demos**.  
Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project combines theory with hands-on experimentation — making OS concepts actually *fun* to learn.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎨 **Beautiful Animated UI** — Clean visuals with particle effects and responsive design.  
- 🧩 **Interactive Lab** — Drag and drop processes and resources to create or prevent deadlocks.  
- 🔁 **Live Simulation** — Watch how circular waits and resource holds lead to system deadlock.  
- 📚 **Deadlock Classifications**  
  - Resource-Based (Reusable & Consumable)  
  - Communication-Based (Synchronization)  
  - Temporal (Static & Dynamic)  
- 🧠 **Educational Notes & Examples** — Based on classic OS textbooks and real-world scenarios.
